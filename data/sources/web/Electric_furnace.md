The electric furnace is the third and last tier of furnace. As its name implies, it uses electricity rather than fuel to operate, removing the need for a fuel belt.

The electric furnace smelts items at the same speed as a steel furnace , and also has two slots for modules . However, it is slightly larger than the other two tiers of furnaces; it occupies a 3×3 area instead of a 2×2 area.
