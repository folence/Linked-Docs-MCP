Space Age expansion exclusive feature.

The Biochamber is a biological variant of the assembling machine and chemical plant , unlocked on Gleba . Unlike most other production buildings, it does not require electricity, but rather a steady supply of nutrients to operate. It has a built-in 50% productivity bonus.

One unit of nutrients will power a biochamber for 4 seconds (0.25 nutrients/s). The powered duration per nutrient can be increased by using efficiency modules , or reduced by modules that increase energy consumption. See the powering biochamber section for more details.

An inactive biochamber uses no energy, but any nutrients contained in its fuel slot continue to spoil . As such, an inactive biochamber will still have nutrients inserted into them if they are available.

The biochamber, like any machine, will not function if there are too many items in its trash slots (usually generated from an input or output spoiling). Unfiltered output inserters will remove items from trash slots.

The biochamber is technically classified as a burner device , and its fuel slot can be filtered ( Middle mouse button by default) to only accept a specific quality of nutrients. This can be used to prevent high-quality nutrients from being consumed as fuel.

Biochambers have the unique property of having negative pollution . This means that, if a biochamber is built on Nauvis , it will absorb pollution. Furthermore, modules that affect pollution (by increasing energy consumption or directly) will make the negative value larger. So heavy use of biochambers with productivity modules and speed modules in beacons can lead to substantial pollution absorption.

## Recipes

The biochamber has a large number of recipes, many of which are exclusive to the biochamber or to Gleba or both.

| Recipe | Ingredients | Products | Made in | Crafted on |
| Yumako processing | 1 1 | 2% 2 |  | - |
| Jellynut processing | 1 1 | 2% 4 |  | - |
| Bioflux | 6 15 12 | 4 |  | - |
| Pentapod egg | 15 30 1 60 | 2 |  |  |
| Agricultural science pack | 4 1 1 | 1 |  |  |
| Iron bacteria | 1 6 | 10% 4 |  |  |
| Copper bacteria | 1 3 | 10% 1 |  |  |
| Iron bacteria cultivation | 4 1 1 | 4 |  |  |
| Copper bacteria cultivation | 4 1 1 | 4 |  |  |
| Fish breeding | 6 2 100 100 | 3 |  |  |

Nutrients are required both as fuel for the biochamber and as a component of other recipes (including artificial jellynut soil and artificial yumako soil ).

| Recipe | Ingredients | Products | Made in | Crafted on |
| Nutrients from yumako mash | 4 4 | 6 |  | - |
| Nutrients from bioflux | 2 5 | 40 |  | - |
| Nutrients from spoilage (50% spoiled) | 2 10 | 1 |  | - |
| Nutrients from fish | 2 1 | 20 |  | - |
| Nutrients from biter egg | 2 1 | 20 |  | - |

The following recipes create stable products that are unaffected by spoilage:

## Powering Biochamber

A biochamber operating without any modules consumes 500 kW of power during operation. Since each nutrient provides 2 MJ of energy, a fully utilized biochamber requires 0.25 nutrients per second.
Note that this nutrient consumption is in addition to any nutrients required by the specific recipe being processed.

The general formula for calculating nutrient usage is

Energy Consumption [MW] Nutrient Yummy Value (2 MJ) = x nutrients/s

The energy consumption of a biochamber is displayed in-game when hovering over it and can also be calculated based on the effects of installed modules.

Below table shows energy consumption and corresponding nutrient usage with various modules.

| Modules | Energy Consumption | Nutrients / s |
| None | 500 kW | 0.25 |
| 4 * Prod 1 (any quality) | 1300 kW | 0.65 |
| 4 * Prod 2 (any quality) | 1700 kW | 0.85 |
| 4 * Prod 3 (any quality) | 2100 kW | 1.05 |
| 4 * Speed 1 (any quality) | 1500 kW | 0.75 |
| 4 * Speed 2 (any quality) | 1700 kW | 0.85 |
| 4 * Speed 3 (any quality) | 1900 kW | 0.95 |
| Efficiency 1 (uncommon) | 350 kW | 0.175 |
| Efficiency 2 (uncommon) | 300 kW | 0.15 |
| Efficiency 3 (uncommon) | 250 kW | 0.125 |
| Max Efficiency (20% energy usage) | 100 kW | 0.05 |
