The iron plate is a material that can be made by smelting iron ore in a furnace , or cast by a foundry .  It is a component or subcomponent of almost every item in Factorio, and it is recommended to create a large stockpile when possible. When smelted in a furnace for a second time, iron plates will transform into steel plates , with a ratio of 5 iron plates per 1 steel plate.

When starting a new freeplay game, the player starts out with 8 iron plates, along with 1 burner mining drill and 1 stone furnace .
