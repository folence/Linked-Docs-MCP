# Vulcanus - Factorio Wiki

**Source:** [https://wiki.factorio.com/Vulcanus](https://wiki.factorio.com/Vulcanus)

Space Age expansion exclusive feature.

Vulcanus is a hot volcanic planet with mountainous volcanoes, rivers of lava, plains of ash, and sulfuric acid geysers.

It is home to demolishers , a large boss‐like enemy that defends its territory. There's no pollution on Vulcanus.

Planet discovery Vulcanus (research) is required to travel to the planet.

## Exclusive items

Tungsten ore and lava can only be found on Vulcanus. A big mining drill is required to mine tungsten ore, while lava can be obtained via offshore pumps used on lava lakes. While Vulcanus is the only source of mineable calcite patches, this resource can also be obtained by other means.

The following recipes can only be crafted on Vulcanus:

- Metallurgic science pack
- Foundry
- Big mining drill
- Turbo transport belt
- Turbo underground belt
- Turbo splitter
- Acid neutralisation

The following items and recipes are unlocked on Vulcanus but can be crafted elsewhere:

- Artillery turret / Artillery wagon and Artillery shells
- Simple coal liquefaction and Coal liquefaction
- Cliff explosives
- Speed module 3
- Asteroid reprocessing (research)

## Surface

### Properties

| Property | Value |
| Pollutant Type | None |
| Day Night Cycle | 1.5 Minutes |
| Magnetic Field | 25 |
| Solar Power | 400% |
| Pressure | 4000 |
| Gravity | 40 |

## Biomes

Vulcanus has three distinct biomes.

- Ashlands are plateaus speckled with sparse vegetation and deposits of coal . They are home to leafless alien trees , some of which may be on fire and will spawn flames temporarily if felled. They are relatively free of cliffs and lava, making them ideal for building.
- Lava basins are filled with winding lava rivers. Within them are deposits of tungsten ore , which can only be mined using the big mining drill.
- Mountains are large volcanoes, covered in cliffs and with a large lava pool at their center. They are home to sulfuric acid geysers and calcite .

## Demolisher territories

Native to Vulcanus are the giant centipede-like enemies known as " demolishers ".

Demolishers have well-defined territories. On the map, these territories are outlined by an opaque, bright red line and the inside is marked by diagonal, translucent, red lines. Only one demolisher will spawn per territory, and the territories themselves do not overlap. However, they are tightly packed, as they follow a Voronoi-like pattern. At the start of the game, only Vulcanus' starting area is not inside a demolisher's territory.

When left alone, a demolisher will patrol the border of its territory. However, if players build inside of a demolisher's territory, it will soon make a beeline towards these buildings with the intent of destroying them. Building inside of a demolisher's territory is therefore extremely risky and dangerous.

The death of a demolisher is permanent, as they only spawn during world generation. Likewise, upon the death of a demolisher, its territory permanently becomes free for the player to use, as other demolishers will not try to expand their territories.

## Access to basic resources

- Water can be obtained via acid neutralisation and steam condensation
- Stone is a byproduct of processing lava into molten iron/copper.
- Iron ore is only available in limited quantities from mining volcanic rock , but iron plate and concrete may be obtained from molten iron
- Copper ore is only available in limited quantities from mining volcanic rock , but copper plate may be obtained from molten copper .
- Coal can be mined from patches on the surface as normal.
- Crude oil is not available, but heavy oil can be obtained via simple coal liquefaction . Heavy oil can then be cracked into light oil and petroleum. Once metallurgic science is produced and a stockpile of heavy oil built up, this can be switched to regular coal liquefaction .
- Wood cannot be obtained, but medium electric poles can be constructed using the small amount of ores available. Note that this can soft-lock players that did not unlock the research.

### Power production

Solar panels on Vulcanus give 4× the power they would on Nauvis. Acid neutralization generates 500°C steam, which can be fed through steam turbines to generate electricity. The calcite processing technology does not actually unlock steam turbines, so nuclear power or heating towers must be researched first, on Nauvis or Gleba respectively. If this is not done, steam engines can be used instead (which generate less power for the same steam).

## Space routes

Vulcanus is connected to 2 other planets: Nauvis and Gleba .

| Planet | Distance (km) |
| Nauvis | 15,000 |
| Gleba | 15,000 |

## Trivia

- In mythology, Vulcanus (also spelt Vulcan), is the Roman god of fire, metalworking, and the forge.
- The planet's design, with lava, volcanoes, and sulfur, is based on lava planets .

## History

- 2.0.7 : Introduced in Space Age expansion.
