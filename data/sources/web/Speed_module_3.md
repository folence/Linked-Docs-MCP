Speed module 3 increases a machine's speed by 50%, its energy consumption by 70%, and decreases its ability to produce quality products by 2.5%. This means that, at the cost of energy, the machine produces more items per minute.

The machine will consume more energy per second, but will also work more quickly. Because energy costs are based on time rather than number of operations, some of the increased energy cost is offset by the reduced time per operation.

Machine speed and energy consumption are increased by 30% compared to tier 1 modules and by 20% percent compared with tier 2 modules.

The quality bonus of any machine can never fall below 0, meaning speed modules cannot reduce the quality of a machine's output. The quality penalty only counteracts the effect of quality modules.

Speed modules also increase pollution, because it is directly proportional to the machine's power consumption, see pollution .

## Achievements

|  | Crafting with speed Craft a speed module 3 . |

## History

- 2.0.7 : Changed all module-3 recipe to require only 4 (instead of 5) module-2 ingredients. Added tungsten carbide as a crafting ingredient. Speed modules incur a quality penalty on crafted items.

- 0.13.0 : Blueprints support modules.

- 0.12.1 : Changed assembling machines' auto-insertion behavior when using speed modules. Faster speed with fast recipes will insert more items, sooner.

- 0.7.1 : Speed module doesn't produce additional pollution (except for pollution increase from speed).

- 0.7.0 : Pollution mechanic introduced.

- 0.6.0 : Introduced
