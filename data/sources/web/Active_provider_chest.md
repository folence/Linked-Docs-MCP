The active provider chest is a large advanced storage item that is part of the logistic network . Logistic robots will pick up items from this chest to move them to requester chests , buffer chests , the player , or storage chests . Logistic robots will actively attempt to move all items within an active provider chest to storage chests when there are no other tasks available.

Active provider chests have the highest priority as pick-up points for logistic robots when fulfilling requests.

The main use-case for active provider chests is to be the output for a production building or process that cannot afford to back up due to outputs not being consumed fast enough. One clear example is with nuclear reactors . A reactor will not start a new cycle if its output is not cleared of depleted uranium fuel cells . By putting them in an active provider chest, logistics robots will frequently remove such cells, ensuring that the chest will only fill up if there is insufficient logistics storage for such fuel cells.

Active provider chests are designed to be emptied. If the player does not want the contained items to be moved until they are specifically requested, then the passive provider chest or buffer chest can be used instead.

## Achievements

|  | Logistic network embargo Finish research with space science pack for the base game or any planetary science pack for Space Age without building any active provider , buffer , or requester chests . |

## History
