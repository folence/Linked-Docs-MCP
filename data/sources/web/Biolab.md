Space Age expansion exclusive feature.

The Biolab is an upgraded version of the lab that is unlocked by researching the biolab technology using agricultural science pack from Gleba .

Biolabs have a built-in speed bonus, meaning research is processed twice as quickly (effectively a 100% speed bonus). Additionally, biolabs have 50% science drain, meaning they consume half as many packs for the same amount of research progress. Put together, these two points effectively mean the biolab consumes science packs at the same rate as the regular lab, but gives double the research progress. This is like a productivity bonus, except it stacks multiplicatively rather than additively with other bonuses.

The speed bonus granted from lab research speed (research) multiplies with the biolab's increased speed.
