The big electric pole is an improved electric pole . It is a more specialized variant compared to the medium electric pole , offering the longest wire reach of all of the electric poles, with the trade-off of a very short supply area. Because of this, big electric poles are ideal for long-distance power lines, as they require the smallest number of entities to be placed to span a given distance, but generally unsuitable for providing local coverage to groups of structures. It can also carry signals for the circuit network .

- The coverage range of big electric pole. (4×4 tiles)
- The wire reach of big electric pole. (32 tiles)

## History

- 2.0.7 : Maximum wire reach increased from 30 to 32. Recipe now uses copper cables instead of copper plates. Electric poles are no longer limited to 5 copper connections to other electric poles.

- 0.17.0 : Medium and Big power pole recipes now use iron sticks.

- 0.16.0 : Electric poles can be opened from the zoomed-to-world view.

- 0.9.0 : Visualizations of Area of effect when hovering on pole. Further optimization on building while holding mouse down.

- 0.7.0 : Poles now auto-connect to all poles in reach with no common neighbor. Building electric poles with shift pressed builds it without any connections.

- 0.6.3 : Max wire distance between poles is limited to the smallest pole's when manually connecting.

- 0.5.0 : Shows what is connected to the electric pole when selected. Added electric network statistics

- 0.4.0 : Introduced
