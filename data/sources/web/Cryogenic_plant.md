Space Age expansion exclusive feature.

The Cryogenic plant is a version of a chemical plant from Aquilo that specializes in cryogenics. Unlike similar machines found on other planets, the cryogenic plant does not have an innate productivity bonus, but it does have 8 module slots.

| Acid neutralisation | 5 1 1000 | 10000 | Calcite processing (research) |  |

The oil cracking and rocket fuel from light oil recipes can be performed in the biochamber , while several other recipes like solid fuel from light oil can only be performed in a chemical plant.

## Notes

- A biochamber with maximum legendary productivity module 3s has a productivity of +150%. A cryogenic plant with 8 legendary productivity module 3s has a productivity of +200%.

## History

- 2.0.7 : Introduced in Space Age expansion.
