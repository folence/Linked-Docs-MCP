Assembling machine 1 is the most basic assembling machine. As Automation is the first technology available, this is the first available crafting machine. It is capable of crafting most recipes, including its own recipe. However, unlike higher tier assembling machines, it cannot use fluids for crafting.

## Trivia

- Between 0.15.0 and 0.15.7, it was an ingredient in the chemical science pack . Between 0.15.7 and 0.16.0, it was an ingredient in the production science pack .

## History

- 2.0.7 : Assembling machines can be configured via circuit networks.

- 0.17.0 : Crafting capability increased from 2 to unlimited recipe ingredients. Can now craft any non-fluid requiring recipe.

- 0.15.0 : Copying from assembling machines to filter inserters will set the filters to the ingredients of the assembling machine recipe.

- 0.12.0 : Assembling machine input slot can contain more than the usual stack size when the recipe requirement demands it.

- 0.10.7 : Fast replacing assembling machine keeps the orientation of the original assembling machine.

- 0.10.1 : New icons

- 0.9.0 : Productivity modules can only be used in assembling machines producing intermediate products.

- 0.8.0 : Crafting speed of assembling machine is relative to manual crafting speed.

- 0.7.3 : Reset bonus productivity of machine when recipe is changed.

- 0.7.0 : Pollution mechanic introduced.

- 0.6.0 : Added support for modules.

- 0.5.2 : The assembling machine 2 speed is now slightly faster (from 1.5 to 2).

- 0.5.0 : Update recipe tooltip for assembling machine output.

- 0.2.1 : Better graphics

- 0.1.0 : Introduced
