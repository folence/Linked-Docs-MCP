The assembling machine 2 is an upgraded version of the assembling machine. It has a faster crafting speed and higher power consumption than the assembling machine 1 . Unlike the first assembling machine, the assembling machine 2 supports crafting with fluids and using modules to increase the speed or efficiency of production.

It can make recipes that include liquids as one of their ingredients (e.g. processing unit ) or products (e.g. empty crude oil barrel ). The input pipe/output pipe connects to the centre of a side. The pipe will only connect when a recipe that requires or produces a liquid is selected. The pipe starts at the top by default, but its location can be rotated by hovering over the machine and pressing R .

## Notes

- An assembling machine 2 with two efficiency module needs less energy than one assembling machine 1 .

## History

- 2.0.7 : Assembling machines can be configured via circuit networks.

- 0.17.0 : Crafting capability increased from 4 to unlimited recipe ingredients. Assembling machine 2 recipe changed to require 2x Steel plate instead of 9x Iron plate.

- 0.15.0 : Copying from assembling machines to filter inserters will set the filters to the ingredients of the assembling machine recipe.

- 0.12.1 : Changed assembling machines' auto-insertion behavior when using speed modules. Faster speed with fast recipes will insert more items, sooner.

- 0.12.0 : Assembling machine input slot can contain more than the usual stack size when the recipe requirement demands it.

- 0.10.7 : Fast replacing assembling machine keeps the direction of the original assembling machine.

- 0.10.1 : Update icons

- 0.9.2 : Assembling Machines 2 and 3 have an input and output pipe.

- 0.9.0 : Productivity modules can only be used in assembling machines producing intermediate products.

- 0.8.0 : Crafting speed of assembling machine is relative to manual crafting speed.

- 0.7.3 : Reset bonus production of machine when recipe is changed.

- 0.7.0 : Pollution mechanic introduced.

- 0.6.0 : Added support for modules.

- 0.5.2 : The assembling machine 2 speed is now slightly faster (from 1.5 to 2).

- 0.5.0 : Update recipe tooltip for assembling machine output.

- 0.2.1 : Better graphics

- 0.1.0 : Introduced
