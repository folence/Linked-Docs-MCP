The spidertron is a versatile lategame vehicle capable of traversing rough terrain. It, along with the car and tank , is one of three non-rail vehicles in Factorio. It's equipped with four fast-firing rocket launchers capable of manual or automatic targeting. It can be driven manually or remotely controlled using the spidertron remote . Furthermore, it has an equipment grid which accepts all equipment modules . Spidertron's legs can be moved by belts which can be prevented by inserting belt immunity equipment into its equipment grid.

The vehicle can be renamed, and its color can be changed independently of the color of the player that is riding inside it. This color and name are shown in the tooltip of all connected spidertron remotes . Additionally, the spidertron's inventory can have logistics requests and auto-trash filters set up, similar to the player inventory, so the vehicle is automatically supplied by logistic robots .

Picking up the vehicle keeps the modules inside its equipment grid, its name, its color and the logistics requests saved in the item, however any content from the spidertron's inventory is placed into the player's inventory and not saved in the item.

## Combat

The four spidertron rocket launchers operate in "chain mode" which allows rapid firing of rockets at enemies. The spidertron can be set to automatically target enemies, both with or without any passengers inside the spidertron. The spidertron's combat capabilities are enhanced by its equipment grid, e.g. energy shields can be equipped to increase its protection or personal laser defenses can be used for higher killing power. The spidertron's equipment modules are used additionally to any modules that the riding player may have equipped in their own power armor .

## Speed

Unlike the car and tank, which are affected by the surfaces they travel on, the spidertron's speed does not change on different surfaces. Due to the way the spidertron travels, its speed slightly fluctuates and does not consistently stay at its top speed. The spidertron does not take any fuel , therefore its speed can be only increased by equipping exoskeletons into its grid. Up to 5 exoskeletons can fit in the vehicle's grid. The top speeds (in km/h) are as follows:

| Equipment | Top speed |
| Default | ~46 |
| 1 exoskeleton | ~57 |
| 2 exoskeletons | ~68 |
| 3 exoskeletons | ~85 |
| 4 exoskeletons | ~90 |
| 5 exoskeletons | ~102 |

## Trivia

- The spidertron was first mentioned in the Friday Facts #120 , however it was not introduced into the game and did not appear on the roadmap. After FFF #120 the spidertron was sometimes hidden in other Friday Facts such as FFF #200 , FFF #315 and FFF #330 . However, the spidertron was not developed further after its first mention: "Than maybe he felt FFF was too short that week, so he made the gif, and it was not touched ever since". [1] It was then introduced in version 1.0.0 as a surprise feature, more than 4 years after it was first teased. [2]
- The spidertron is the only item in the game to require raw fish as a crafting ingredient. It is not known for certain why this is the case, although it could be to limit the automatability of spidertron production (since raw fish production is challenging to automate).
- In Space Age , the ingredients for a spidertron are shared between Nauvis and Gleba . Both raw fish and the uranium-235 needed for the portable fission reactor can only be obtained on Nauvis, while the carbon fiber needed for rocket turrets can only be acquired on Gleba . As such, automating spidertron production requires regular transport between the two planets.
- A legendary spidertron with its equipment grid filled with 55 legendary toolbelt equipment modules has a total inventory size of 1575 slots.
