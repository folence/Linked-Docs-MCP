The fast inserter is an electric inserter that is more than twice as fast as the regular inserter .

For more information on mechanics and uses see inserters .

## History

- 2.0.7 : All inserters now have filter option. All filter inserters crafted before 2.0.7 have been turned into fast inserters.

- 0.13.2 : Inserters connected to the circuit network now have the option to only read hand contents.

- 0.13.0 : Inserters can now send the item held in hand to the circuit network. Inserters are able to squeeze things slightly better to belts. more resources. All types of inserters can be controlled by the circuit and logistic network, once the respective network is researched. Power drain and consumption increased, no longer more efficient than Inserters.

- 0.12.2 : Inserters will never take more than the max stack size of an item. Inserters and logistic robots no longer extract from enemy chests Inserters now correctly pick up items from splitters

- 0.12.0 : Inserters can now extract from Roboports and Beacons. Inserters now take items from right behind them, not from the center of the pickup target entity.

- 0.10.0 : New icon New sounds

- 0.9.2 : Inserters can have arbitrary pickup and insert positions.

- 0.9.0 : Inserter code optimisation, inserters that have nothing to do will sleep.

- 0.8.0 : Improved inserter's ability to pull from train wagons.

- 0.7.1 : Fast inserter now has the same speed as the smart inserter.

- 0.5.0 : Inserter can now pick up up to 5 items when researched.

- 0.4.0 : Smaller inserter bounding box

- 0.3.0 : New Inserter graphics

- 0.2.1 : The item in the hand of the inserter is returned to the player when mined.

- 0.2.0 : Show direction of inserter

- 0.1.0 : Introduced
