The Express underground belt is the third tier of underground belts . It has a maximum underground length of 8 tiles ‒ 2 more than a fast underground belt and 4 more than a basic underground belt. The speed of the express underground belt is the same speed as the express transport belt , which is three times as fast as a basic transport belt or underground belt.

Note that underground belts as well as underground pipes cannot transport items beneath lava and space void.
