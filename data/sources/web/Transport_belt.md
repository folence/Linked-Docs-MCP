The transport belt is the easiest and cheapest method of automatic item transportation. It is the first tier of transport belts .

No prior research is required and it is available from the beginning of the game.

## History

- 0.17.0 : Increased throughput from 13.33 to 15. Consistently holds 8 items per tile.

- 0.15.0 : Increased stack size from 50 to 100.

- 0.13.0 : Transport belt is now connectible to the circuit network . Transport belt connectible entities will now disconnect from incoming belts when marked for deconstruction.

- 0.12.0 : Items on transport belts don't go off the belt at the end, so the transport belt has to go directly in front of the required inserter. Optimised the transport belt movement.

- 0.11.9 : Items marked for deconstruction cannot be moved by belts anymore. Reduced the CPU load caused by big counts of inserters loading/unloading transport belts.

- 0.9.7 : Belts to be deconstructed no longer accept items.

- 0.9.6 : New transport belt graphics.

- 0.9.0 : Small optimisation.

- 0.6.0 : Transport belt doesn't pull player out of the edge of it (like items), so player won't be almost trapped on faster transport belts.

- 0.5.0 : Better movement on transport belts in turns and crossings.

- 0.2.8 : Cross connections of transport belt of the same type are disabled.

- 0.2.2 : When transport belts are rotated (or replaced with different than opposite direction), items on transport belt are collected.

- 0.2.1 : Small optimisation.

- 0.1.0 : Introduced.
