Space Age expansion exclusive feature.

Quality module increases a machine's ability to make quality items by 1% and decreases its speed by 5%. This means that, at a small cost of items produced per minute, the machine produces slightly more items of higher quality.

While players are required to own Space Age to access this feature, quality is a separate mod, and can be activated independent of most Space Age content.

All levels of quality module have the same speed penalty.

Speed modules have a penalty to quality, which negates some of or all of the effectiveness of quality modules.
