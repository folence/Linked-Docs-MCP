Construction robots are autonomous floating devices capable of repairing or building the player's structures. They are one of two type of floating robotic devices, the other being the logistic robots . They run on electricity from roboports , or a personal roboport .

## Mechanics

Construction robots accomplish various tasks, including:

- They repair damaged entities using repair packs .
- They replace destroyed entities as long as they are available in a provider chest or storage chest .
- They remove entities marked with the deconstruction planner . Removed entities are transported into storage chests; if a requester / buffer chest has an unfulfilled logistics request for the item being deconstructed then construction bots will prioritise placing items directly in to these chests. This includes environmental entities such as fish and trees ; cliffs can be "deconstructed" if a construction robot has access to cliff explosives in a provider or storage chest in their network, or in the player's inventory.
- They add entities marked with a blueprint or placed as ghosts as long as these entities are available.  Entities are fetched from the closest logistic chest.
- They can carry up to four items at once, depending on the researched worker robot cargo size . They can use the items to build up to four tiles at once, but they can only build one entity at a time.

Construction robots have no means of defending themselves and do not run when they encounter enemies. Because they often operate at the "front", they are in high danger to be destroyed. Despite being a floating entity, ground units using melee are still capable of destroying them, and any fire (such as ones from flamethrower turrets ) can also damage them.

Researching more cargo or more speed for the logistic bots are also valid for the construction robots. Note that more speed will also increase the robots' energy consumption.

## Achievements

|  | Automated cleanup Deconstruct 100 objects with the construction robots . |

|  | Automated construction Construct 100 machines using robots . |

|  | You are doing it right Construct more machines using robots than manually. |

## History

- 2.0.7 : Construction robots consider the amount of robots currently traveling to roboports to charge before deciding which roboport to charge at. Construction robots can be assigned multiple tasks instead of only being given new ones after completing their current task. Construction robots attempt to always charge at a roboport closer to their final destination Increased battery capacity of construction robot from 1.5MJ to 3MJ.

- 0.17.75 : Construction robots will attempt to batch build tiles.

- 0.17.0 : Construction robots can blow up cliffs. Landfill can be built by construction robots and be included in blueprints.

- 0.15.0 : Fish can be collected by construction robots.

- 0.12.4 : Construction robots when used by the player will take primarily from the player's inventory, then the hotbar. Construction robots will check if their target is still in the network area when they return to personal roboport for charging.

- 0.12.0 : Construction robots can now be used by the player via a personal roboport embedded into a type of modular armor.

- 0.11.17 : AI of the construction robots improved.

- 0.10.2 : Construction robots take as many repair packs as they can when going to repair.

- 0.10.0 : Construction robots no longer die of lack of electricity, they just slow down to 20% of their normal speed.

- 0.9.0 : The deconstruction planner can be used to order bots to destroy buildings/trees.

- 0.8.6 : Robots can rebuild land mines .

- 0.8.1 : Construction robots now use the durability of the repair packs when using them.

- 0.8.0 : Introduced
