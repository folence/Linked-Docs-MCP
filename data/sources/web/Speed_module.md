Speed module increases a machine's speed by 20%, its energy consumption by 50%, and decreases its ability to produce quality products by 1%. This means that, at the cost of energy, the machine produces more items per minute.

The machine will consume more energy per second, but will also work more quickly. Because energy costs are based on time rather than number of operations, some of the increased energy cost is offset by the reduced time per operation.

A speed module 1 requires a significant power increase for very little (less than half the standard rate) throughput increase, the worst amongst its group. By contrast a speed module 3 will produce a much better proportion of throughput, for a similar power requirement downside compared to this tier 1 speed module.

The quality bonus of any machine can never fall below 0, meaning speed modules cannot reduce the quality of a machine's output. The quality penalty only counteracts the effect of quality modules.

Speed modules also increase pollution, because it is directly proportional to the machine's power consumption, see pollution .

## History

- 2.0.7 : Speed modules incur a quality penalty on crafted items.

- 0.13.0 : Blueprints support modules.

- 0.12.1 : Changed assembling machines' auto-insertion behavior when using speed modules. Faster speed with fast recipes will insert more items, sooner.

- 0.7.1 : Speed module doesn't produce additional pollution (except for pollution increase from speed).

- 0.7.0 : Pollution mechanic introduced.

- 0.6.0 : Introduced
