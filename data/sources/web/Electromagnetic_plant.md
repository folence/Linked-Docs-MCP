Space Age expansion exclusive feature.

Electromagnetic plant is an assembling machine type from Fulgora that specializes in the production of electronics and electromagnets. Its size is 4×4, has a production speed of 2, a built-in productivity bonus of +50% and 5 module slots.

It's unique for the built-in productivity bonus, because unlike productivity modules , this built-in productivity is not restricted to intermediate products only and instead applies to all craftable recipes.

## Trivia

- The absolute maximum output rate achievable with a single electromagnetic plant is 301 times the standard output rate of its selected recipe. This is achieved by using a legendary electromagnetic plant with five legendary productivity module 3s , along with 12 legendary beacons with two legendary speed module 3s each; This gives the electromagnetic plant a crafting speed of 109.5 and a productivity bonus of 175%.

## History

- 2.0.7 : Introduced in Space Age expansion.
