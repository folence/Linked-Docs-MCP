The underground belt is the first tier of underground belts .  This type of belt is generally used to allow a transport belt to cross another transport belt by going underneath it. The underground belt has a maximum underground distance of 4 squares.

The speed of the underground belt is the same as the speed of the basic transport belt .

Note that underground belts as well as underground pipes cannot transport items beneath lava and space void.
