The electric mining drill mines out iron ore , copper ore , uranium ore , stone and coal , and places it in front of the output tile, on a belt or in a machine or chest that covers the output tile.

The machine is 3×3, but mines in a 5×5 area, extending 1 tile away on each side.
Mines copper ore, iron ore, coal, or stone at a rate of 0.5/s and uranium ore at a rate of 0.25/s.

When placed over uranium ore, which requires sulfuric acid to mine, three fluid connectors will appear on the mining drill. The mining drills will pass excess sulfuric acid to each other when these connectors are aligned, allowing multiple drills to be placed right next to each other with only one pipe input necessary to feed all of them.

## Indicators

There is a light attached to the front of the mining drill that will change colors depending on its status:

Green light = The drill is currently functioning without issues.

Yellow light = The drill's ability to dispense resources is blocked, it is low on power, it is disabled by the circuit network or it is missing the fluid required to mine the current resource.

Red light = The drill has completely run out of resources to mine.

## Achievements

|  | Mining with determination Completely deplete a resource patch. |

## History

- 0.18.46 : Electric mining drill graphics now fill bounding box more accurately.

- 0.18.44 : Reworked Electric mining drill graphics, removing their vertical structure - to fix tile overlapping and other issues introduced with redesign.

- 0.18.31 : New electric mining drill graphics.

- 0.17.0 : Unified and rounded mining speed and times for ores and drills.

- 0.15.2 : Changed mining drill fluidbox to allow fluid to flow to pipes without the use of pumps.

- 0.15.0 : Mining drill now has fluid input when placed over uranium ore . Mining drills can be turned on and off using the circuit network . They can also output the remaining expected resources.

- 0.8.1 : Mining drill now ignores resources that can't be mined because of the higher hardness.

- 0.7.3 : Shows area of effect when highlighted. Mining drill evenly mines from every tile in its area.

- 0.7.0 : Pollution mechanic introduced. Added support for modules to electric mining drills. Mining drills deactivate when out of resources.

- 0.5.1 : Show output arrows when alt mode is on.

- 0.5.0 : New Graphics.

- 0.2.0 : Shows count of available resources.

- 0.1.0 : Introduced

## Trivia

- From 0.15.7 to 0.17.0, it was a component of the chemical science pack .
