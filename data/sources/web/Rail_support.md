Space Age expansion exclusive feature.

A Rail support is placed under an elevated rail , acting as its foundation. When planning out elevated rails, supports will be automatically added between some units of rails. Supports act as obstacles, and can be removed at any time if one is added.

While players are required to own Space Age to access this feature, elevated rails are a separate mod, and can be activated independent of most Space Age content.

## Placement

Each rail support can hold up to five straight rail segments in either direction. It can also accommodate two curved rail segments, or a mix of one curved segment and three straight segments. Elevated rails are naturally able to be placed over most obstacles, such as buildings, cliffs , and water. However some buildings, like big electric poles are too tall to have elevated rails placed above them.

Rail supports can be placed on top of water on Nauvis , oil oceans on Fulgora , marshes on Gleba and ammoniacal oceans on Aquilo without the need for landfill or foundation . After researching rail support foundations , they can also be placed on Fulgora's deep oil oceans.

## Elevated rails vs landfill

For an elevated rail, to place 5 rails over water requires 1 elevated rail support, or a total raw of 66 iron ore and 40 stone (not including rail ramp or rails ), and for landfill , to place 5 rails over water requires 20 landfill, or a total raw of 1000 stone (not inculding rails ). Therefore it's significantly more efficient to use elevated rails rather than using landfill.

## History
