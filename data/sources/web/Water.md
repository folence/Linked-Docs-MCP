Water is a liquid which can be infinitely extracted from water tiles using an offshore pump . In Space Age , water can also be produced by a chemical plant by condensing steam or melting ice . After being pumped or produced it is distributed via pipes .

Water can be used to generate electricity by converting it to steam via boilers or heat exchangers . The specific heat capacity of water is 2kJ / Δ°C / unit . However, one unit of water converts to ten units of steam, which has a heat capacity of 200J / Δ°C / unit . That is, it takes 200 joules to heat one unit of steam by one degree Celsius. Water is also used as an ingredient in various recipes.

Surface water acts as an obstacle that cannot normally be traveled over. A spidertron can reach across water if another bit of land is sufficiently close, and wearing mech armor allows the player to fly over water.

Raw fish are spawned in water tiles during world generation only, and do not reproduce naturally. Water tiles can be removed completely by placing landfill over them. Pollution will turn nearby water green, which is a visual-only effect (the effect can be turned off by disabling animated water in the graphics settings). The color changes relative to the current amount of pollution around it, so decreasing pollution purifies the water.

## Shallow water

Shallow water can appear alongside (or in place of) normal water. Shallow water can be walked on, but buildings can't be built in it directly. Shallow water can still have landfill placed upon it. Shallow water will reduce the speed of the player as well as wheeled vehicles . The speed reduction does not affect enemies or the spidertron . Offshore pumps can be used where shallow water meets land (including landfill).

Shallow water appears as one of two shades of blue lighter than that of standard water, with the mildly lighter blue and moderately lighter blue reducing the player's walking speed by 30% or 20% respectively. In the base game, shallow water is not generated by the default map generator , so it can only be found in the tutorial . In Space Age , Gleba is the only planet with naturally generated shallow water, and it is found there in abundance.

## History

- 1.0.0 : Added polluted water visual effect.

- 0.18.0 : Water is animated.

- 0.17.0 : Added two levels of shallow water tiles (only placed by map editor, not generated). Enemies and vehicles can travel over shallow water. Water is generated as large lakes instead of swamps. Better controls in the map generator GUI for water, tiles and cliffs.

- 0.13.0 : Landfill can be used to replace water with grass.

- 0.9.1 : Water settings in map generation have more effect.

- 0.1.0 : Introduced
