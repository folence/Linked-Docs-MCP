The passive provider chest is a storage item that is part of the logistic network . Logistic robots will pick up items from this box to move them to the player or requester chests , but only in this direction. This makes them useful for storing items assembled in any particular area - useful as a buffer between belts or at the end of a belt. If you want the contained items to later be consolidated in storage chests, then use the active provider chest instead.

Construction robots will pick up items for construction, replacement of destroyed entities and repair packs from passive provider chests.

Passive provider chests have the lowest priority as pick-up points for logistic robots. Logistic robots will not empty passive provider chests if the requested items are available in active provider chests and/or storage chests .
