# Space Age - Factorio Wiki

**Source:** [https://wiki.factorio.com/Space_Age](https://wiki.factorio.com/Space_Age)

Space Age expansion exclusive feature.

Space Age is a paid expansion pack of Factorio that was released on October 21st 2024. It contains a set of 3 extra mods.

The mods are:

- Space Age, featuring 4 new planets, space platforms, and a reworked tech tree
- Quality, allowing drastic improvements to buildings and items as a "vertical" growth
- Elevated Rails, for improved rail routing and better intersections

"Quality" and "Elevated Rails" are both dependencies for "Space Age", but can be enabled separately.

The expansion is not available for the Nintendo Switch version of the game due to space and memory constraints. [1]

## Space Age

The Space Age mod expands the tech tree and adds four new planets for the player to travel to using space platforms , each with their own new resources, gameplay mechanics, original music, and unique challenges.

- Vulcanus , a molten, waterless planet whose pools of lava can be casted into metal.

- Fulgora , a lightning-prone desert planet where the only resource is piles of scrap left by an alien civilization.

- Gleba , a moist, overgrown world of plants and fungi whose biological products eventually degrade into spoilage.

- Aquilo , a desolate, freezing globe of liquid ammonia where machines freeze without heating.

Space Age adds 29 achievements, 30 intermediate products, 22 buildings, 8 hours of new original music, 5 science packs , 5 weapons, 4 planets, and 2 enemy types. Instead of launching a rocket, the end goal of Space Age is to build a space platform capable of reaching the solar system edge .

## Quality

The Quality mod introduces four higher quality tiers for all items, structures and equipment with improved attributes. The goal of quality is to allow vertical factory upgrading as alternative to expansion in size. Items of higher quality are created by chance when using the new quality modules in the producing structure. When enabled with the Space Age mod, the two highest quality tiers require technology from Gleba and Aquilo.

In addition, the Quality mod also includes the recycler , a building capable of turning most items back into their ingredients, albeit at a 75% loss.

## Elevated Rails

Adds rail ramps and rail supports to build elevated rails . Elevated rails act as a second layer of track above the ground, allowing most buildings to be placed underneath. Elevated rails are particularly useful at building more efficient intersections, crossing difficult terrain, or bridging the oceans of Nauvis or the oil oceans of Fulgora.
