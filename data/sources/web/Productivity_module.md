Productivity modules applies a productivity bonus to items produced in a machine, allowing the machine to produce more items for the same inputs. It adds 4% productivity to the affected machine.

Productivity modules can generally only be used to make intermediate products . These are items that are used in other recipes and cannot directly be placed. For more information, see Module#Productivity_module . There are quite a few exceptions to this general rule.

## History

- 1.1.0 : Productivity module 1 decreases speed of the machine by 5% instead of 15%.

- 0.17.0 : Since the catalysts have been tweaked, the kovarex enrichment process can now be used together with productivity modules.

- 0.15.2 : The "Kovarex enrichment process" is no longer usable with productivity modules.

- 0.13.0 : Blueprints support modules. Productivity module pollution production reduced from 30% to 5%.

- 0.9.7 : Crafting speed penalty reduced from 20% to 15%. Productivity module energy consumption reduced from 50% to 40%.

- 0.9.0 : Usage in assembling machines is limited to intermediate products. Added crafting speed penalty of 20%.

- 0.7.3 : Restricted use of productivity modules in beacons.

- 0.7.0 : Pollution mechanic introduced.

- 0.6.0 : Introduced
