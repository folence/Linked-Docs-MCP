Nauvis is the main setting of Factorio's base game, and the first of five planets that can be visited in Factorio: Space Age . It is an Earth-like planet featuring a variety of biomes, such as deserts, lakes of liquid water , and forests.

### Exclusive Items

- Raw fish
- Uranium ore

The following items, buildings, and recipes are unlocked by Gleba 's Agricultural science pack

- Fish breeding can only be performed on Nauvis.
- Wood processing which yields tree seeds , can only be performed on Nauvis, making it the only place where wood is renewable.
- Biter egg
- Captive biter spawner Biter and spitter spawners can exist only on Nauvis
- Biolabs can only be placed on Nauvis.

### Properties

| Property | Value |
| Pollutant Type | Pollution |
| Day Night Cycle | 7 Minutes |
| Magnetic Field | 90 |
| Solar Power | 100% |
| Pressure | 1000 |
| Gravity | 10 |

### Biomes

Nauvis has a few distinct biomes:

- Grasslands features plains of green grass. Large parts of these are covered with trees .
- Sandy Desert has barren terrain, with a few dead trees scattered about.
- Red Desert

### Natural Resources

The native raw resources on Nauvis are Iron ore , Copper ore , Coal , Stone , Uranium ore , Crude oil , Water , Wood , and Raw fish . Among these, only water and crude oil are renewable with local research , as their sources do not run dry.

Out of these nine resources, the first five are found in ore patches and harvested using a Burner mining drill , an Electric mining drill , or a Big mining drill . In addition, Uranium Ore requires a constant supply of Sulfuric acid in order for the drills to function and can't be mined using Burner mining drill.

Water is harvested by placing an Offshore pump on the side of a lake. It will produce water indefinitely, as water does not run out. It requires no energy or fuel.

Crude oil is harvested by placing a Pumpjack on an oil field. It requires energy to function. With continuous use, the same oil field will produce oil at a gradually slower rate, but this decrease in production will stop when production is at 20% of its initial value, making crude oil a renewable resource on Nauvis.

Stone, coal, wood, and raw fish can be obtained by mining naturally spawning entities. (In case of stone and coal, this is in addition to being found in ore patches.) Mining a Rock will yield stone, and if it is "huge", it will also yield coal. Trees yield wood when mined. Finally, "mining" a fish (shown as a dark, moving spot in water) will yield the fish as five items.

## Mechanics

### Pollution

On Nauvis, many buildings produce pollution while active. This pollution is local to the chunk on which it is produced, but will spread to other chunks over time. It is consumed by Nauvis' natural environment, but if it reaches a spawner , it will provoke an attack from its biters / spitters .

## Space routes

Space Age expansion exclusive feature.

Nauvis is connected to 3 other planets: Vulcanus , Fulgora and Gleba .

| Planet | Distance (KM) |
| Fulgora | 15,000 |
| Gleba | 15,000 |
| Vulcanus | 15,000 |
