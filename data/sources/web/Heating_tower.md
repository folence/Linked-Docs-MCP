Space Age expansion exclusive feature.

The heating tower burns fuel to generate heat. Initially unlocked on Gleba , it is useful for burning off unneeded biological products as well as providing electrical power. It later becomes a vital source of heat against the cold of Aquilo . The heating tower has 250% efficiency, so it generates 2.5 times the fuel value in heat of any fuel given to it.

The internal heat of heating towers is limited to 1000°C. Like a nuclear reactor, heating towers will continue to burn fuel even if they have reached their maximum heat. The fact that they burn fuel regardless of temperature makes them more useful than a boiler for destroying unneeded biological materials. Also like a reactor, you can read their heat and fuel status through the circuit network .

The heating tower has a heat capacity of 5 MJ/°C. Thus, they can buffer 2.5GJ of heat energy across their working range of 500°C to 1000°C, and they require 2.43 GJ of energy to warm up from 15°C to 500°C when initially placed. Because of the efficiency however, this means they only need 0.97 GJ of fuel to reach 500°C, which is slightly less than 10 rocket fuel . More fuel will be needed to bring the connected heat pipes and heat exchangers up to temperature.

Note that heating towers produce less pollution per unit energy produced than boilers. Boilers produce 3.6 MJ per pollution generated, while heating towers produce 24 MJ per pollution. This coupled with their efficiency makes them a more efficient and clean alternative to boilers on Nauvis .
