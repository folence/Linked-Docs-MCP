The Oil Refinery processes crude oil or coal into 3 different fluids: heavy oil , light oil and petroleum gas .

Oil products have many uses. Although they can be turned into solid fuel to fuel boilers and furnaces, they are usually used to create plastic bars , which are used in advanced circuits , and sulfur , which is used in more advanced items. They are also used as ammunition for flamethrower turrets .

## Recipes

The refinery has three/four available recipes, out of which one must be set before it can begin processing.

| Process | Input | Output | Required technology |
| Basic oil processing | 5 100 | 45 | Oil processing (research) |
| Advanced oil processing | 5 100 50 | 25 45 55 | Advanced oil processing (research) |
| Coal liquefaction | 5 10 25 50 | 90 20 10 | Coal liquefaction (research) |
| Simple coal liquefaction | 5 + 10 + 2 + 25 | 50 | Calcite processing (research) |

## Troubleshooting

When the refinery is working, a flame comes out of the chimney.

- You need to choose the recipe, otherwise it won't work.
- It will stop working if any of the products are not properly drained from it (that is, 100.0 heavy oil at output will prevent production of the 2 other fluids).

## History

- 2.0.7 : Fluid inputs and outputs can now be flipped. Simple coal liquefaction added.

- 0.17.60 : Basic oil processing produces only Petroleum gas, for more streamlined oil setup in the beginning. Basic oil processing keeps some of the refinery input/output slots unused, so it is more clear which ones will be used by Advanced oil processing.

- 0.15.0 : Module slots increased from 2 to 3.

- 0.11.6 : Now disconnects from pipes when recipe is reset.

- 0.9.1 : Now accepts modules Added cracking recipes

- 0.9.0 : Introduced
