Efficiency module 3 reduces the electricity cost to run the machine by 50% of its base energy usage. Efficiency modules also reduce the nutrient consumption of the biochamber .

Note that minimal energy usage is 20% of base energy usage, but using more than 80% worth of efficiency modules makes sense if other modules are used, as they increase power usage and that effect is additive with the decrease from efficiency modules.

Efficiency modules also reduce pollution, because it is directly proportional to the machine's power consumption, see pollution .
