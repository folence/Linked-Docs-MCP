The tank is a heavy armored fighting vehicle . It is a mid-game vehicle with three weapons; an integrated submachine gun , a short range flamethrower and a powerful cannon that uses cannon shells . It, along with the car and spidertron , are the three non-rail vehicles in Factorio. In multiplayer , it is possible for a player to enter a tank alongside another player. The passenger can take control of the weapons of the tank using a switch in the GUI of the tank, but cannot steer the tank.

Since engine units can only be built in assembling machines , tanks (like cars) cannot be built from scratch by hand from their raw materials. If the tank is destroyed, its inventory is destroyed with it, though the player gets ejected and not killed. Tanks will change color based on the color of the player who drove it last.

Tanks can be driven remotely. Coupled with the tank's equipment grid, the player can remotely manipulate distant outposts without being there as well as to remotely expand the base by attacking enemy nests . However, unlike the spidertron, the tank lacks any map-revealing capabilities, and so is effectively confined to areas where the player has sufficient radar coverage. The tank and its weapons continue to operate normally if driven outside of visual range, but if the player "exits" the vehicle while in the fog of war then the tank will be stranded until visual contact can be re-established.

## Combat

The tank is a strong fighting vehicle due to its large health pool and the very high damage of its main weapon, the cannon. Construction robots can also repair the tank with repair packs , and the tank can even bring its own robots to do so using the personal roboport equipment.

The tank's weaponry can be augmented by equipment modules like the personal laser defense . If the player is inside of the tank, the player can deploy thrown items such as grenades , poison capsules , and follower robots from within the tank. The tank particularly shines in battle against worms , as their high damage projectiles are much less of a problem for an entity with a high health pool. Defensive equipment or capsules/drones can be used to deal with mobile enemies.

The tank has a lower base speed than the car and is less maneuverable than a player outside of a vehicle. As a result, it may not perform as well in combat against melee enemies or enemies with shorter range than the player, as it has more difficulty dodging enemies and avoiding cliffs . This may result in the tank being destroyed quickly, leaving the player in a tight spot.

## Movement

The tank is very robust, and unlike the car can move through and destroy trees without taking damage. Even when not moving, simply driving into an entity is enough to damage it. This can also be employed as a weapon against enemies , although certain enemies and structures (nests in particular) will deal high damage to the tank in the process, requiring repair after skirmishes.

The tank's default speed is slower than the car, and movement speed bonuses from terrain (e.g. concrete ) are substantially reduced. Unlike the car, the tank can be rotated in place without moving forwards or backwards.

The speed and, in particular, responsiveness of the tank can be improved somewhat by burning better fuel . The tank, like all other vehicles, gains top speed and acceleration bonuses when running on solid fuel, rocket fuel and nuclear fuel, as opposed to wood or coal. The bonuses are +5% / +15% / +15% top speed and +20% / +80% / +150% acceleration for solid fuel, rocket fuel and nuclear fuel, respectively; wood and coal both yield the base level of top speed and acceleration.

Exoskeletons can also be installed into the tank's equipment grid to increase its top speed as though the tank was the player. Equipping 3 exoskeletons allows the tank to outrun a car on any natural terrain, and with 5 exoskeletons the tank surpasses the car's maximum possible speed. Increasing the tank's speed with exoskeletons does not affect the tank's acceleration or deceleration, so it will take some time for the tank to accelerate to its top speed, as well as to stop from that speed. Given how destructive the tank can be to buildings, using many exoskeletons in a tank can make it dangerous to one's own base.

## Speeds

### Tank top speed (km/h)

Top speed with various fuels on different tiles

|  | Wood | Coal | Solid fuel | Rocket fuel | Nuclear fuel |
| Sand | 50.1 | 50.1 | 54.8 | 67.1 | 79.1 |
| Grass | 50.9 | 50.9 | 55.8 | 68.3 | 80.5 |
| Red desert | 50.9 | 50.9 | 55.8 | 68.3 | 80.5 |
| Dirt | 51.4 | 51.4 | 56.8 | 69.6 | 82.0 |
| Stone path | 53.4 | 53.4 | 58.5 | 71.6 | 84.4 |
| Shallow water | 53.9 | 53.9 | 59.1 | 72.3 | 85.3 |
| Concrete * | 55.0 | 55.0 | 60.3 | 73.8 | 87.0 |
| Refined concrete * | 55.0 | 55.0 | 60.3 | 73.8 | 87.0 |

* The same stats apply to the hazard version of these surfaces.

### Speed in reverse

The top speed of the tank in reverse is ~70.6% of the forward top speed.

## Capsules and Bots integration

The player directly driving the tank cannot fire any weapons equipped on the player. However, the player still has access to their inventory. The player can use inventory items, such as capsules and combat robots . The player's equipment modules are also available, so the player's construction robots run by a personal roboport can still be deployed from within the tank, which will use repair packs from the player to repair the tank. If the tank and the player both have personal laser defenses , both can be active at the same time.

Upon researching logistic system , the tank can utilize the logistic network to make requests like a player.

## Exclusive Weapons

### Flamethrower

A powerful short-ranged weapon that consumes flamethrower ammo . Unlike the hand-held flamethrower or the flamethrower turret , the tank version does not set entities on fire.

### Cannon

The tank's cannon is one of the few weapons that damages anything in a line between the tank and the target. All cannon shells have the ability to pierce targets, which means that if the shell deals enough damage to kill what it hits, the shell can continue onward and deal damage to another target.

Standard cannon shells deal significant damage to a single target and have large piercing potential, while explosive cannon shells damage all targets in an area which makes them useful for dealing with large enemy groups. There are uranium versions of both shell types which deal even more damage.
