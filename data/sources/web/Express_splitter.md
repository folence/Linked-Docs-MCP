Express splitters are splitters which are three times as fast as normal splitters and 50% faster than fast splitters . The items are placed in 1:1 relation on the outgoing belts. It is possible to set a filter and input and output priorities as described on belt transport system .

## History

- 2.0.67 : Splitters can be connected to the circuit network .

- 0.17.0 : Match express transport belt speed of 45 items/per second.

- 0.16.17 : Added filter to splitter. Added input and output priority to splitter.

- 0.16.16 : Changed splitters so they work more intuitively. The left and right lane splitting is now completely independent. The decision whether item goes to left or right output is now independent of the item type.

- 0.11.0 : Fast/express splitters are now made from their lesser variants. Express splitters require lubricant.

- 0.5.0 : Introduced New graphics.
