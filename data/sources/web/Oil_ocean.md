Space Age expansion exclusive feature.

Oil oceans separate the islands of Fulgora . The seas slow down the player and most vehicles, but they can traverse them regardless. However, almost no entities can be built on oil oceans. The exceptions to this are Rail supports , Rail ramps , and Foundation (which allows you to build anything over the oil oceans). Deep parts, the dark colors, of the oil ocean cannot have rail supports or ramps placed on them until Rail support foundations is researched. This technology requires Metallurgic science packs from Vulcanus.

By placing an offshore pump on the edge of an island, heavy oil is infinitely extracted from the oil oceans, much like water is from lakes on Nauvis . Other oil products can be produced via cracking .
