Space Age expansion exclusive feature.

The lightning collector is an upgraded version of the lightning rod from Fulgora that protects a larger area from getting struck by lightning, as well as converting each strike to more electricity than its counterpart. Like the lightning rod, the peak power production is limited only by the demands of the connected electric system , but the internal storage is subject to a 150 MW drain in addition to the load from the electric system.

Also like the lightning rod, the lightning collector cannot be crafted on any planet other than Fulgora, due to the other planets' lack of a strong magnetic field.
