The storage chest is a large advanced storage item that is part of the logistic network . Logistic robots store any items taken out of the player's logistic trash slots here, as well as items picked up from active provider chests . Construction robots will use stored items to repair damaged entities and construct ghosts , as well as storing items picked up as a result of a deconstruction order ; this includes the wood / stone / coal from trees & rocks which were in the way of a ghost placement, and any items in other chests or on belts or inside buildings such as assembling machines when they are marked for deconstruction. Storage chests can be filtered to only accept one type of item from the logistic network.

### Notes

- Logistic robots will pick up items in the following priority: active provider chests > storage chests, buffer chests > passive provider chests
- Logistic robots will begin to fill storage chests from active provider chests if there are no other tasks available.
- Logistic robots, and construction robots fulfilling deconstruction orders, will fill storage chests in the following priority: Storage chests with a matching logistics filter and which already contain the item Empty storage chests with a matching logistics filter Unfiltered storage chests which already contain the item Empty and unfiltered storage chests Unfiltered storage chests containing other items
- The filter that can be set on the storage chest is respected even if items that are actively being pushed to the network can not be stored anywhere else.
- If a logistic robot carrying an item is unable to deliver its cargo (e.g. if the player moves out of range), it will drop its cargo in a storage chest before moving to other tasks.
