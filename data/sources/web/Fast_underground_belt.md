The fast underground belt is the second tier of underground belts . It has a maximum underground distance of 6 tiles — 2 more than the basic underground belt. The speed of the fast underground belt is the same speed as the fast transport belt , which is twice as fast as a basic transport belt or underground belt.

Note that underground belts as well as underground pipes cannot transport items beneath lava and space void.
