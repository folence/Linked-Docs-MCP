A Rail is used for building a railway track for trains . Unlike transport belts , rail tracks can also be curved and placed diagonally. Train stops , rail signals and rail chain signals can be placed on rails to better guide automated trains. Gates can also be placed on rails, making them rail gates. In Space Age , rails can be connected to rail ramps and rail supports to build elevated rails. Elevated rails allow trains to freely pass over obstacles.

The minimum rail turning radius is 13, meaning the smallest possible 180° turn has 26 tiles between the centers of opposite rails. However, due to rails being two tiles wide, the actual footprint is 28 tiles wide.

The rail planner can be used to automatically place rails. See the page for more info.

## Achievements

Rails are directly related to the following achievements:

|  | Trans-Factorio express Have a train plan a path 1,000 tiles or longer. |

## History

- 2.0.7 : Added rail ramps, rail supports and elevated rails to build bridges. ( Friday Facts #378 ) New rail shapes, rail curves, 22.5 degree tracks.

- 0.13.0 : Rail planner tool simplifies rail building. Improved the rail selection logic. Halved the mining time of rails. Removed the curved rail, rail is the only type now.

- 0.12.11 : Replaced entity type rail with types straight rail and curved rail

- 0.11.17 : Increased the stack size of Straight Rails to 100 from 50.

- 0.11.0 : Gates built on rails now make them rail gates. Added end of track graphics.

- 0.9.0 : Rails are now crafted in pairs. Nicer rail diagonals/turns on minimap.

- 0.7.1 : Added remnants for destroyed rails.

- 0.5.0 : Rails are not minable when a train is on them. Rails recipe changed, now needs steel and stone Rails made more expensive

- 0.2.8 : Correction of bounding boxes of some built curved rails.

- 0.2.1 : Rail building and selection boxes

- 0.1.0 : Introduced
