The offshore pump produces fluids from lakes and oceans; the fluid generated is based on the contents of the lake it is placed alongside. It must be placed on a shoreline of a body of fluid lake or ocean on the map, and connected to a pipe or other object that accepts liquids . It produces 1200 units of fluid per second. It does not require electricity or fuel to operate.

Offshore pumps are frequently used to provide water for steam engines , though several crafting recipes also require water. One offshore pump can generate enough water to support 200 boilers, which in turn can support 400 steam engines. For more information, see power production .

### Placements

- On Nauvis , when placed in lakes, it collects water .
- On Gleba , when placed in marshes or lakes, it collects water .
- On Vulcanus , when placed in lava, it collects lava .
- On Fulgora , when placed in oil oceans, it collects heavy oil .
- On Aquilo , when placed in the ammoniacal sea, it collects ammoniacal solution .

The fluid supply from an offshore pump is endless; it will not dry up the body of fluid it is attached to. Additionally, the size of the body of fluid the pump is connected to does not affect the rate of fluid generation. Filling in the water around a pump by using landfill will rename the pump to "Water well pump" and it will keep producing fluid.

## History

- 2.0.13 : Offshore pump speed increases with quality .

- 2.0.7 : Can be placed on lava , oil ocean , and ammoniacal seas in Space Age . Offshore pump now requires 2x Iron gear wheel, 3x Pipe. (was 2x Electronic circuit + 1x Iron gear wheel + 1x Pipe)

- 0.18.10 : New offshore pump graphics. Offshore pump is now buildable on ground tile adjacent to water instead of water tile adjacent to ground.

- 0.16.16 : Changed size of offshore pump from 3x1 to 3x2 in order to prevent pump placement in overlapping positions.

- 0.15.0 : Increased water output from 60 to 1200 units per second. (Undocumented)

- 0.12.1 : Copy paste now works on pump.

- 0.12.0 : Connectable to the circuit network.

- 0.9.2 : Now specifies the liquid it will produce.

- 0.5.1 : New graphics.

- 0.1.0 : Introduced
