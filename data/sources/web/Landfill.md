Landfill can be used to replace water with usable land, regardless of the type of surrounding terrain. Landfill is placed using Left mouse button and the area in which it is placed can be increased and decreased by using Numpad + and Numpad - . Land-filled area is indistinguishable from normal terrain in terms of mechanics; it can be normally built and walked over. Once an area has been filled, the landfill can be removed by holding Right mouse button with landfill in the cursor. Construction robots will remove landfill marked for deconstruction with a deconstruction planner .

With the use of construction robots , landfill can automatically be placed below ghost buildings planned on water.

Note that placing a landfill where raw fish are swimming will "destroy" them without being collected.
