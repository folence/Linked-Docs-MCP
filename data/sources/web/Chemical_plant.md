The chemical plant is a building for processing fluids and solids, usually through chemical processes. Many recipes that either require or provide a fluid other than crude oil are produced here. The chemical plant has 2 inputs and 2 outputs in fixed positions (their positions can be flipped). Solid items can be both inserted and removed by inserters from any point (no need to target fluid input/output connections).

When chemical plants are in the process of crafting an item, they will billow out smoke that matches the color of their input ingredients.

## Base Game Recipes

The chemical plant has twelve available recipes in the base game, one of which must be set before it can begin processing.

| Recipe | Input | Output | Technology required |
| Sulfuric acid | 1 1 5 100 | 50 | Sulfur processing (research) |
| Heavy oil cracking | 2 30 40 | 30 | Advanced oil processing (research) |
| Light oil cracking | 2 30 30 | 20 | Advanced oil processing (research) |
| Solid fuel | 1 10 | 1 | Advanced oil processing (research) |
| Solid fuel | 1 20 | 1 | Oil processing (research) |

| Flamethrower ammo | 6 5 100 | 1 | Flamethrower (research) |

## Space Age Recipes

Space Age expansion exclusive feature.

The Space Age Expansion adds 15 new recipes, some of which must be crafted on a specific planet. Several recipes are not exclusive to the chemical plant and can be crafted with other buildings, usually the cryogenic plant .

| Recipe | Input | Output | Technology Required | Crafted on | Also crafted in |
| Ice melting | 1 1 | 20 | Space platform thruster (research) |  |  |
| Thruster fuel | 2 2 10 | 75 | Space platform thruster (research) |  |  |
| Thruster oxidizer | 2 2 10 | 75 | Space platform thruster (research) |  |  |
| Advanced thruster fuel | 10 2 1 100 | 1500 | Advanced asteroid processing (research) |  |  |
| Advanced thruster oxidizer | 10 2 1 100 | 1500 | Advanced asteroid processing (research) |  |  |
| Carbon | 1 2 20 | 1 | Tungsten carbide (research) |  |  |
| Acid neutralisation | 5 1 1000 | 10000 | Calcite processing (research) |  |  |
| Steam condensation | 1 1000 | 90 | Calcite processing (research) |  |  |
| Holmium solution | 10 1 2 10 | 100 | Holmium processing (research) |  |  |
| Coal synthesis | 2 1 5 5 | 1 | Rocket turret (research) |  |  |
| Fish breeding | 6 2 100 100 | 3 | Fish breeding (research) |  |  |
| Ammoniacal solution separation | 1 50 | 5 50 | Planet discovery Aquilo (research) |  |  |
| Solid fuel from ammonia | 1 50 20 | 1 | Planet discovery Aquilo (research) |  |  |
| Ammonia rocket fuel | 10 3 50 500 | 1 | Planet discovery Aquilo (research) |  |  |
| Lithium | 20 1 50 50 | 5 | Lithium processing (research) |  |  |

Aquilo's recipes can be selected while on other planets, but because they require liquids that are exclusive to Aquilo and cannot be shipped off-planet, those recipes are effectively locked to the planet.

## Fluid inputs

Unlike solid ingredients, which can be inserted anywhere, the fluid ingredients can only be added at the two fixed inputs. Furthermore, recipes which requires two fluid ingredients, will only accept each ingredient on a specific input. When the recipe that requires fluid ingredients is selected, the chemical plant will display icons on the inputs to show which ingredient goes to which input. These fluid inputs can be flipped with H or V .

## History

- 2.0.7 : Fluid inputs and outputs can now be flipped.

- 0.18.0 : Updated sound effects.

- 0.17.0 : Crafting speed decreased from 1.25 to 1.0.

- 0.15.0 : Module slots increased from 2 to 3.

- 0.11.6 : Oil refinery and chemical plant are now disconnected from pipes when the recipe is reset.

- 0.10.0 : Unused pipe connections don't connect to pipes. Fluid input amount is limited to 2× recipe cost. Fluid inputs for the chemical plant are now saved properly.

- 0.9.1 : Now accepts modules.

- 0.9.0 : Introduced
