The boiler uses fuel to convert water into steam at 165°C suitable for use in a steam engine . It has two water connectors on opposite ends and passes water through to adjacent equipment such as other boilers. The boiler features a single output for the steam it produces. It only consumes fuel as it creates steam. Boilers used in conjunction with offshore pumps and steam engines are a vital part of early power generation .

For each unit of water, 10 units of steam are produced. Inserting one coal (4 MJ) into a boiler then using the resulting steam in a steam engine will supply 4 MJ of energy to an electrical system. It costs 300 kJ to heat 1 unit of water to into 10 steam at 165°C, so one boiler will produce 60 steam per second.

Inserters can insert fuel into boilers. However, using powered inserters to move fuel into a boiler can be problematic should fuel become unavailable: if no power is being produced, then powered inserters fueling a boiler cannot operate. Using at least one burner inserter , which uses fuel and not electricity, ensures that at least one inserter is available to restart a single boiler. Inserters can also remove fuel from boilers, allowing inserters to move fuel down a chain of boilers.

## History

- 2.0.7 : 1 Water will now produce 10 Steam in boilers/heat exchangers.

- 0.15.10 : Steam became a separate resource, boilers now produce steam rather than high temperature water that is displayed as steam This distinction is meaningful for circuit network accounting of steam and the coal liquefaction recipe

- 0.15.0 : New graphics. Changed boiler dimensions to 3×2. 'Steam' is produced on a separate connector rather than heating water passed through. At this time, steam is actually water that is renamed when over 100 degrees. Significantly increased energy consumption/production.

- 0.13.0 : New fire graphics for boilers.

- 0.9.2 : Enabled the inserter to take fuel out of boilers.

- 0.8.0 : Flickering light added to furnaces and boilers.

- 0.6.1 : Boilers show their fuel inventory in the entity info.

- 0.5.1 : Boilers are now fast-replaceable with pipes. New boiler graphics.

- 0.1.0 : Introduced
