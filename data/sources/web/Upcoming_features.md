**Source:** [https://wiki.factorio.com/Upcoming_features](https://wiki.factorio.com/Upcoming_features)

This is a list of publicized information about the upcoming 2.1 update. As of July 8, 2025, very little information has been shared, including the release date. This page will be updated as more information becomes available.

## Factorio 2.1

- As of November 21, 2024, 2.1 is not actively being worked on in favor of fixing all bugs from 2.0/Space Age
- New achievements: Lead developer Kovarex plans to add a "bunch of new achievements", which could make a 100% run "even more convoluted". [1] This may or may not include a special achievement that could only be acquired by getting all other achievements in a single playthrough.

## Nintendo Switch 2

- The Nintendo Switch version of the game is available on both the Nintendo Switch and its successor, the Nintendo Switch 2. As of July 8, 2025, both versions are practically identical.
- Developer twinsen is looking at the possibility bringing the Space Age expansion to the Switch 2, along with an update to take advantage of its greater hardware capabilities. [2] The release date of this theoretical update is currently unknown.
