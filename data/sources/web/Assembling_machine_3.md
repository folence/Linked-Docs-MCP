The assembling machine 3 is the third and final tier of assembly machines, having the fastest crafting speed of all three. Like the assembling machine 2 , it can use liquids in crafting.

## Trivia

- An assembling machine 3 with max energy reduction (80%) only needs as much energy as an assembling machine 1 .
- It is the only assembling machine capable of crafting faster than the player (crafting speed 1), without the use of modules or quality.
- In the base game, the assembler's maximum possible crafting speed is 11.25, using 12 beacons filled with speed module 3s . This uses 2.5MW on the assembler alone, and requires 8.3MW in total to run.
- In Space Age , using 12 legendary beacons with legendary speed module 3s results in the machine having 78.6 crafting speed

## History

- 2.0.7 : Assembling machines can be configured via circuit networks.

- 0.15.0 : Copying from assembling machines to filter inserters will set the filters to the ingredients of the assembling machine recipe.

- 0.12.1 : Changed assembling machines' auto-insertion behavior when using speed modules. Faster speed with fast recipes will insert more items, sooner.

- 0.12.0 : Assembling machine input slot can contain more than the usual stack size when the recipe requirement demands it.

- 0.11.4 : Assembling machine 3 has up to 6 ingredient slots, so it can make any recipe in its category.

- 0.10.7 : Fast replacing assembling machine keeps the direction of the original assembling machine.

- 0.10.1 : Update icons

- 0.9.2 : Assembling Machines 2 and 3 have an input and output pipe.

- 0.9.0 : Productivity modules can only be used in assembling machines producing intermediate products.

- 0.8.0 : Crafting speed of assembling machine is relative to manual crafting speed.

- 0.7.3 : Reset bonus production of machine when recipe is changed.

- 0.7.0 : Pollution mechanic introduced.

- 0.6.0 : Added support for modules.

- 0.5.0 : Update recipe tooltip for assembling machine output.

- 0.2.1 : Better graphics

- 0.1.0 : Introduced
