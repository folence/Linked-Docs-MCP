The pipe to ground (or "underground pipe") is a distribution method for liquids and gases . Since a basic pipe is impassable, these are necessary to keep the factory open, as well as to cross belt lines or environmental features.

Comprehensive information on fluid distribution can be found on the fluid system page.

## Notes

- While pipe to ground is the developer name for the entity, the community has taken to simply referring to this entity as "underground pipe". This is the most common reference.
- The maximum distance at which an underground pipe can connect is 10 tiles, resulting in a gap of 9 tiles in between.
- The gap between underground pipes does not store any fluids; a pair of underground pipes only has the same volume as two regular pipes, regardless of distance bridged.
- Underground pipes as well as underground belts cannot transport items beneath lava and space void.

## History

- 2.0.7 : Underground pipes now turn green (instead of the default yellow) when placed at the maximum distance. Changed pipe to ground collision mask so player can walk on top of it.

- 0.13.0 : Underground pipes are now automatically placed at maximum distance when building by dragging.

- 0.10.1 : Icon changes.

- 0.9.3 : For two different pipe to ground types, the distance limit is now the minimum of the two connections.

- 0.9.2 : Pipe to ground can now reach up to 10 tiles underground. A pipe to ground can have multiple underground connections.

- 0.9.0 : Pipe to grounds are made in pairs, and are more expensive to craft.

- 0.2.1 : Automatic 180 degree rotation of underground pipes when the first pipe is built.

- 0.2.0 : Visualization of the connection between two underground pipes.

- 0.1.0 : Introduced
