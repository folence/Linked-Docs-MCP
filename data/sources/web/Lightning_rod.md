Space Age expansion exclusive feature.

The lightning rod is a building from Fulgora that protects an area from getting struck by lightning from the nightly storms. When struck, they generate power for a limited time . The peak power production is limited only by the demands of the connected electric system , but the internal storage is subject to a 150 MW drain in addition to the load from the electric system. It is unlocked by researching the Planet discovery Fulgora technology.

The lightning rod cannot be crafted on any planet other than Fulgora, as other planets lack the same strong magnetic field.
