Steel chests are the largest of three types of chests used for basic item storage. Steel processing must be researched before they can be built. Steel chests, like other chests, can be connected to the circuit network to provide their contents as a signal.

A steel chest can contain 48 stacks of items. This is 50% more than an iron chest and 3 times the capacity of a wooden chest . Steel chests are used to create all logistic chests, which all share the steel chest's 48-stack capacity.
