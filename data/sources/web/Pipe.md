The pipe is the most basic method of distribution of fluids. It is commonly used to provide water from offshore pumps to boilers and steam to steam engines for power generation, and later on, crude oil and oil products . Unlike transport belts , players and enemies can't walk over them.

Comprehensive information on fluid distribution can be found on the fluid system page.

Attempting to build a pipe that would potentially mix two liquids will fail, as the pipe won't be placed. Undesired fluid can be flushed from the pipe system by opening the pipe GUI and clicking the trash button next to the fluid. Fluids that are flushed from pipes are deleted permanently.

## Gallery

- Failed attempt to mix fluids.
- GUI of a pipe inside a fluid system containing water.
- The GUI of liquids going through pipes when ready to place more pipes.

## History

- 2.0.7 : Reworked the fluid system flow logic. ( https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-416 ) Contiguous sections of pipes and storage tanks are merged into segments. Each segment contains a single fluid, and throughput is proportional to how full a segment is.

- 0.15.0 : Increased stack size from 50 to 100.

- 0.13.0 : Underground pipes and belts are placed at max connecting distance apart when built by dragging.

- 0.11.6 : The Oil refinery and chemical plant are disconnected from pipes if the recipe is reset.

- 0.10.1 : Added new icons

- 0.10.0 : Unused pipe connections are passive and do not connect to pipes.

- 0.9.1 : Pipes now refresh their connection to storage tanks when rotated. Small quantities of fluid can be pushed/destroyed by larger quantities in pipes.

- 0.9.0 : New graphics. All terminating pipes now have visuals. Pipes now show fluid inside when ALT mode is enabled. Optimized bounding boxes.

- 0.5.1 : The boiler is now fast-replaceable with pipes, and vice versa. New graphics.

- 0.2.0 : Visualization of connection to a pipe to ground.

- 0.1.0 : Introduced
