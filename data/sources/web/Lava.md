Space Age expansion exclusive feature.

Lava is a resource found on Vulcanus , where it is extracted from lava lakes via an offshore pump . It is a fluid and can pass through pipes like any other fluid. The foundry can process lava into molten iron or molten copper . Both of these processes require calcite . They both also produce stone as a byproduct, though the copper version produces more stone than than iron.

Lava is exclusive to Vulcanus. It cannot be barreled , so it cannot be shipped to other planets.

Inserters and the player can drop items in the lava, permanently destroying them.

Underground pipes and underground belts cannot transport items under lava, however elevated rails can be built over lava. Rail supports and rail ramps can't be built on lava without foundations , which limits the distance that elevated rails can travel over lava lakes. Unlike water , lava cannot be filled in with landfill , but only with foundations just like oil oceans on Fulgora .
