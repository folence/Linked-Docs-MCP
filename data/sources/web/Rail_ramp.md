Space Age expansion exclusive feature.

A rail ramp is a rail that inclines upward, which allows trains to travel over obstacles. Rails that continue off the higher part of the ramp must have rail supports to keep them elevated. Train stops , rail signals and rail chain signals cannot be placed on rail ramps, unlike straight rails. Locomotives that are stopped on rail ramps will stay still and not slide back down to the ground level. Ramps do not affect train acceleration.

While players are required to own Space Age to access this feature, elevated rails are a separate mod, and can be activated independent of most Space Age content.

## Placement

The raised part of rail ramps can be placed on top of water on Nauvis , oil oceans on Fulgora , marshes on Gleba and ammoniacal oceans on Aquilo without the need for landfill or foundation . After researching rail support foundations , rail supports and rail ramps can also be placed on Fulgora's deep oil oceans. The first 4 tiles of the ramp needs to be placed on solid ground.

Being able to build the rail ramp on the edge of solid ground can be very useful when space is limited, such as on the small vault islands on Fulgora .
