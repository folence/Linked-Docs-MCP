The steam turbine consumes steam to create electric energy. It is usually used together with heat exchangers and a nuclear reactor or heating tower .

While designed for the 500°C steam of a nuclear reactor, turbines can still be connected to boilers for use in conventional 165°C steam power. At this mode, the steam turbine acts equal to two separate steam engines , producing 1800 kW and consuming 60 steam/sec. However, actual power production is based on the temperature of the steam, not the building itself. This means that using a steam turbine is no more fuel-efficient than using two steam engines. Unless saving space within a large build, it is not necessary to use the more costly turbines for boiler steam.

## Power output

Each steam turbine takes a maximum input of 60 units of 500°C steam per second and outputs 5.82MW of electricity; the 5.8MW listed on the tooltip is rounded.

- Heat exchanger converts water to steam at a 1:10 ratio, and heats it from 15°C to 500°C;
- It takes 0.2 kJ of heat energy to raise 1 steam 1°C;
- Steam is consumed by steam turbines at a rate of 60 units per second;
- (500°C - 15°C) × 0.2 kJ × 60 units/s = 5820 kJ/s, or 5.82 MW.
- On the other hand, the calculation for the Boiler-generated steam is: (165°C - 15°C) × 0.2 kJ × 60 units/s = 1800 kJ/s, or 1.8 MW.
