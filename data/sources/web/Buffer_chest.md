The buffer chest is a large advanced storage item that is part of the logistic network , and combines the functions of both a requester chest and a passive provider chest . The buffer chest's purpose is to be an "in-between" chest for ferrying items from provider chests to the player, construction robots , or requester chests. In Space Age , rocket silos are also served by buffer chests.

Like requester chests, buffer chests can be configured to request a specified number of up to 1000 types of items from the logistic network. Logistic robots will then bring the specified items from provider chests or storage chests until the request is met. In addition, similar to a passive provider chest, any items contained in a buffer chest are made available to construction robots, logistic requests from the player, and requester chests that have the "Request from buffer chests" checkbox checked. However, items in a buffer chest are not used to fulfill requests from other buffer chests.

By using SHIFT + Right mouse button and SHIFT + Left mouse button to copy-paste a recipe from an assembling machine to a buffer chest , the buffer chest is automatically configured to request enough ingredients for 30 seconds of continuous crafting.
