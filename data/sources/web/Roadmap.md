## Factorio 2.1

- Work on Factorio 2.1 will begin after fixing bugs in 2.0 and Space Age. As of November 22, 2024, this is expected to take at least 2 months.

- 2.1 will contain finishing touches and other changes "too big for putting into 2.0".

- The Factorio team are also playing with ideas for a new game. Lead Developer Kovarex is thinking about something "related to [World of Warcraft] in a similar way as to how Factorio is related to Minecraft" [1]

## Factorio: Space Age

Factorio: Space Age is a paid expansion pack that was released on October 21, 2024 . It consists of 3 official mods which can be enabled and disabled at will. It cost $35.00 USD, or the same price as the base game.

- Space Age, featuring 4 new planets, new buildings, new enemies, space platforms, and a reworked tech tree
- Quality, allowing drastic improvements to buildings and items as a "vertical" growth
- Elevated Rails, for improved rail routing and better intersections

Quality and Elevated Rails are both prerequisites for Space Age, but can be enabled on their own.

## Factorio 2.0

- Factorio 2.0 is a free update to the base game released alongside Space Age. It features numerous quality of life improvements, performance optimizations, and other small tweaks. Some features included: Improved control of train systems Better blueprint building Better flying robot behaviour
