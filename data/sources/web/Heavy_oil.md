Heavy oil is a liquid produced by refining crude oil in an oil refinery or extracted on Fulgora using an offshore pump . It can be processed into light oil , solid fuel and lubricant . It is more efficient to process heavy oil into light oil before creating solid fuel from it. It can also be used as ammo in flamethrower turrets .

Heavy oil can be obtained on Vulcanus using simple coal liquefaction . This can be upgraded to coal liquefaction once some initial heavy oil has been obtained.

| Building | Process | Results |
| Oil refinery | Advanced oil processing | 5 + 100 + 50 → 25 + ( 45 + 55 ) |
| Oil refinery | Coal liquefaction | 5 + 10 + 25 + 50 → 90 + ( 20 + 10 ) |
| Oil refinery | Simple coal liquefaction | 5 + 10 + 2 + 25 → 50 |
