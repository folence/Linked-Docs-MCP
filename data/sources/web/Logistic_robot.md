Logistic robots are autonomous floating devices capable of transporting resources in a logistic network . They are one of two types of floating robotic devices, the other being construction robots .

The basic movement speed of logistic robots is 0.05 tiles/tick (3 tiles per second) when they have enough power. When out of power, robots move at 20% of their current normal travel speed. This movement speed can be increased infinitely by the worker robot speed (research) .

Logistic robots have no means of defending themselves and do not run when they encounter enemies. Despite being a floating entity, ground units using melee are still capable of destroying them.

By default, each robot can only carry one item. This limit can be increased up to four items by the worker robot cargo size (research) . Robots consume power per tile traveled, additionally to consuming power per second spent in the air. When they run out of power, they have to recharge at a roboport , or a personal roboport , depending on where the robots were originally placed. Alternatively, they can be mined out of the air by the player which restores their internal power buffer, allowing the player to redeploy them immediately.

### Notes

- Logistic robots will pick up items in the following priority: active provider chests > storage chests , buffer chests > passive provider chests
- Logistic robots will begin to fill storage chests from active provider chests if there are no other tasks available.
- The filter that can be set on the storage chest is respected even if items that are actively being pushed to the network can not be stored anywhere else.
- If a logistic robot carrying an item is unable to deliver its cargo (e.g. if the player moves out of range), it will drop its cargo in a storage chest before moving to other tasks.
- Logistic bots are slightly slower than construction robots , and cost more advanced materials to craft
- Note that researching more robot speed will also increase the robots' energy consumption.

## Achievements

|  | You've got a package Supply the character by logistic robot . |

|  | Delivery service Supply the character with 10k items delivered by logistic robots . |

## History

- 2.0.7 : Logistic robots consider the amount of robots currently traveling to roboports to charge before deciding which roboport to charge at. Logistic robots can be assigned multiple tasks instead of only being given new ones after completing their current task. Logistic robots attempt to always charge at a roboport closer to their final destination Logistic bots now appear red in the map view robot overview if they have an assigned task involving the player (delivery or trash).

- 0.15.0 : Added warning for situation when robots don't have storage place to put items in the logistics network.

- 0.12.27 : Logistic robots now prefer items at the end of the inventory and ignore inventory limits.

- 0.12.2 : Logistic robots no longer extract from chests belonging to other forces.

- 0.11.2 : New Graphics.

- 0.10.3 : Improved the AI of the logistic robots.

- 0.10.1 : Logistic robots will not insert items that would exceed the requested count.

- 0.10.0 : Logistic robots no longer die of lack of electricity, they just slow down to 20% of their normal speed.

- 0.9.3 : Logistic robots now need a flying robot frame to craft.

- 0.8.0 : Logistic robots take items on the way to chests into consideration when trying to keep separate chests for separate items.

- 0.7.5 : Increased stack size of robots from 16 to 32.

- 0.7.3 : Logistic robots delivery is evenly distributed between provider/requester chests.

- 0.7.1 : Power of the logistic robot speed upgrade technology has been increased. (25% of basic speed cumulative.) Removed the limit of one logistic robot order per tick.

- 0.7.0 : Logistic robots try not to mix different items in storage chests, if possible.

- 0.6.0 : Player can directly request supplies from logistic robots. New Graphics.

- 0.3.0 : New Graphics.

- 0.2.1 : Technologies added to increase the stats of the logistic robot.

- 0.2.0 : Introduced
