The substation is an advanced electric pole . It offers a vast supply area with a wire reach long enough to accommodate efficient coverage of an area with very few dead spots, if handled properly. However, this comes at a cost of larger dimensions of the substations, which may make them difficult to place, and their production involves relatively advanced components. It can also carry signals for the circuit network .

- The coverage range of substation. (18×18 tiles)
- The wire reach of substation. (18 tiles)

## History

- 2.0.7 : Recipe now uses copper cables instead of copper plates. Electric poles are no longer limited to 5 copper connections to other electric poles.

- 0.16.0 : Electric poles can be opened from the zoomed-to-world view.

- 0.15.0 : Increased the substation supply area (16×16 to 18×18) and wire reach (16 to 18).

- 0.4.0 : Introduced
