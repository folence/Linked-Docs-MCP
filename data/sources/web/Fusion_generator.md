Space Age expansion exclusive feature.

The fusion generator consumes plasma from the fusion reactor to generate electric energy and fluoroketone (hot) .

Fusion generators generate an amount of energy based on the temperature of the plasma feeding the generator. However, they can only extract so much energy from plasma over a particular amount of time. This is 50 MJ per second, producing 50 MW of power. This increases with quality .

When plasma is consumed to generate electricity, an amount of hot fluoroketone is also generated equal to the amount of plasma consumed. If this fluid is not removed from the generator, it will be unable to generate power. Fluoroketone must be removed and taken to a cryogenic plant for cooling into fluoroketone (cold) (usually to be fed back into a fusion reactor).

The fusion generator has nine fluid connection points: two plasma inputs, five plasma outputs for passing plasma to other generators, and two hot fluoroketone outputs. Because plasma cannot go into pipes, fusion generators will have to be placed in close proximity to fusion reactors. Each generator must also have space for outputting fluoroketone into pipes to be cooled. While generators are immune to freezing on Aquilo , the output pipes for hot fluoroketone can freeze. So on Aquilo, extra space must also be used around generators for heat pipes to heat the output pipes.
