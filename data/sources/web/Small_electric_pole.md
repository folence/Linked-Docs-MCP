The small electric pole is the basic electric pole . It has a short wire reach and small supply area, but it is also available from the beginning of the game. Typically, it is replaced in factories by medium electric poles later in the game.  It can also carry signals for the circuit network .

## Gallery

- The coverage range of small electric pole. (5×5 tiles)
- The wire reach of small electric pole. (7.5 tiles)

## History

- 0.17.0 : Small electric poles are no longer usable as fuel.

- 0.16.0 : Electric poles can be opened from the zoomed-to-world view.

- 0.11.0 : Small electric poles now have a fuel value.

- 0.9.8 : New small pole graphics.

- 0.9.0 : Visualizations of Area of effect when hovering on pole. Further optimization on building while holding mouse down.

- 0.7.0 : Poles now auto-connect to all poles in reach with no common neighbor. Building electric poles with shift pressed builds it without any connections.

- 0.6.3 : Max wire distance between poles is limited to the smallest pole's when manually connecting.

- 0.5.0 : Shows what is connected to the electric pole when selected. Added electric network statistics

- 0.2.1 : Made building of electric poles more convenient

- 0.1.0 : Introduced
