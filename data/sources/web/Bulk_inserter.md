The bulk inserter is an electric inserter that can move multiple items at the same time. Moving at the speed of the fast inserter , it transfers multiple items per cycle to give it a material flow advantage at the cost of additional power consumption.

When transferring between chests or cargo wagons it picks up and drops off the entire stack of items instantly. When picking up from or dropping off items onto a transport belt a bulk inserter needs to grab or drop each item individually, increasing the time between arm swings and lowering its potential throughput. In these cases, however, the bulk inserter still has higher throughput than a fast inserter because it swings back and forth less often. The throughput from chest to chest for a fully upgraded bulk inserter is 27.69 items per second, but only 13.85 items/s from chest to express belt .

A bulk inserter cannot carry more items than the item's stack size.

## Stack size

The stack size is increased by the inserter capacity bonus (research) technology. The stack size can be overridden to set how many items it picks up at one time, with the maximum being the highest research level currently unlocked.

| Inserter capacity bonus | Stack size bonus | Total stack size |
| none | 0 | 2 |
| 1 | +1 | 3 |
| 2 | +1 | 4 |
| 3 | +1 | 5 |
| 4 | +1 | 6 |
| 5 | +2 | 8 |
| 6 | +2 | 10 |
| 7 | +2 | 12 |
