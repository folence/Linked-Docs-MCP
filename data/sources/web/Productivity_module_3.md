Productivity module 3 applies a productivity bonus to items produced in a machine, allowing the machine to produce more items for the same inputs. It adds 10% productivity to the affected machine.

Productivity modules can generally only be used to make intermediate products . These are items that are used in other recipes and cannot directly be placed. For more information, see Module#Productivity_module . There are quite a few exceptions to this general rule.
