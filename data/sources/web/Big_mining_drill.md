Space Age expansion exclusive feature.

The big mining drill is the stronger and larger big brother of the electric mining drill . It has the unique property of reducing resource drain from mining by 50%, which means the resource underneath the drill's mining area only has its richness depleted half of the time. This effect directly multiplies with the productivity of the drill in terms of the amount of resources that can be extracted from a single patch. The big mining drill is also able to mine harder ores such as tungsten that the lower tier mining drills cannot. Much like the electric mining drill, it is able to use fluids via pipe connection.

Additionally, researching stack inserters and transport belt capacity will allow the big mining drill to output items to a belt in stacks.

## Indicators

There is a light attached to the front of the mining drill that will change colors depending on its status:

Green light = The drill is currently functioning without issues.

Yellow light = The drill's ability to dispense resources is blocked, it is low on power, or it is disabled by the circuit network .

Red light = The drill has completely run out of resources to mine or it is missing the fluid required to mine the current resource.

## History

- 2.0.7 : Introduced in Space Age expansion.
