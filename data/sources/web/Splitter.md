The splitter is used to divide a single belt, combine two belts into one, or equally balance two belts together. The items are placed in 1:1 relation on the outgoing belts. It is possible to set a filter and input and output priorities as described on belt transport system .

### Other basic belts

| Transport belt | Underground belt |

### Other Splitters

| Fast splitter | Express splitter | Turbo splitter |

## History

- 2.0.67 : Splitters can be connected to the circuit network .

- 0.17.0 : Match transport belt speed of 15 items/per second

- 0.16.17 : Added filter to splitter. Added input and output priority to splitter.

- 0.16.16 : Changed splitters so they work more intuitively. The left and right lane splitting is now completely independent. The decision whether item goes to left or right output is now independent of the item type.

- 0.13.0 : Renamed "basic splitter" to "splitter".

- 0.11.0 : Fast/express splitters are now made from their lesser variants.

- 0.5.0 : Added fast and express splitters New graphics.

- 0.4.1 : Draw ending/starting pieces of underground belt and splitter.

- 0.3.0 : Splitter now has a maximum memory of 5 items when forced to send items on one side because the other one is blocked.

- 0.2.9 : Introduced
