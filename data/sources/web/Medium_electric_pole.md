The medium electric pole is an improved electric pole that is superior to the small electric pole in all regards, requiring slightly more expensive resources to produce. Although it lacks benefits of more advanced, specialized variants, it is a consummate all-rounder with decent reach, supply area and size. It can also carry signals for the circuit network .

- The coverage range of medium electric pole. (7×7 tiles)
- The wire reach of medium electric pole. (9 tiles)

## History

- 2.0.7 : Recipe now uses copper cables instead of copper plates. Electric poles are no longer limited to 5 copper connections to other electric poles.

- 0.17.0 : Medium and Big power pole recipes now use iron sticks.

- 0.16.0 : Electric poles can be opened from the zoomed-to-world view.

- 0.9.0 : Visualizations of Area of effect when hovering on pole. Further optimization on building while holding mouse down.

- 0.7.0 : Poles now auto-connect to all poles in reach with no common neighbor. Building electric poles with shift pressed builds it without any connections.

- 0.6.3 : Max wire distance between poles is limited to the smallest pole's when manually connecting.

- 0.5.0 : Shows what is connected to the electric pole when selected. Added electric network statistics

- 0.4.0 : Introduced
